## machine learning methods
### supervised learning
      With guidence
### unsupervised learning
      without guidence
 In supervised learning that have two task
 
      * classsification
           assign numerical values
      * regression
           it have finite ,discreate values 
           
 In unsupervised learning that have two task
 
      * clustering  
      * association
