# Probability distribution
   A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. 
  This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible values.
## uniform probability distribution
   probability distributions with equally likely outcomes
## log normal(graph-Asymmetric)
   It is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.

## covarience
  measure the direction of the relationship between two variables.
