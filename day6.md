# probability
- Probability is the likelihood that an event will happen.
##### in the case of coin,
- The probability of getting heads or tails when tossing a fair coin is 1/2.
## probability distribution
   it is a statistical function that describes all the possibile values and take within a given range.
### types
 - normal distributed or guassian distributed
    In naormal distribution the mean value "0" and standard deviation is "1".
## sampling
   sampling is a process of statistical analysis in which reserchers take a predetermined number of observations from a larger populations.
 - sample
   It is the specific group that you will collect data from.
 - population
 -  it represent the entire data.
## sampling distribution
   The mean value of a samples called sampling distribution.
### significant level
  - significant level of alpha=0.01
  - default significant level of alpha=0.05
# central limit theorem
  The distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's distribution.
# hypothesis
