# probability
- Probability is the likelihood that an event will happen.
##### in the case of coin,
- The probability of getting heads or tails when tossing a fair coin is 1/2.
## probability distribution
   it is a statistical function that describes all the possibile values and take within a given range.
### types
 - normal distributed or guassian distributed
    In naormal distribution the mean value "0" and standard deviation is "1".
## sampling
   sampling is a process of statistical analysis in which reserchers take a predetermined number of observations from a larger populations.
 - sample
   It is the specific group that you will collect data from.
 - population
 -  It represent the entire data.
## Sampling distribution
   The mean value of a samples called sampling distribution.
### Significant level
  - Significant level of alpha=0.01
  - Default significant level of alpha=0.05
# Central limit theorem
  The distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's distribution.
# Hypothesis
  - Hypothesis is an assumption about an association.
  - Hypothesis is made at the very beginning and the goal is to either reject or not reject the hypothesis.
  - Test the hypothesis based on your data.
  - The analysis of the data is done with hypothesis test.
## Null hypothesis
   There is no difference between two or more groups.
## Alternative hypothesis
   There is a difference between two or more groups.
# Z-Test
  Is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different or to compare one mean to a hypothesized value when the variances are known and the 
  sample size is large.

# T-Test
  is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related.
