## Law of large number
   It states that a sample size gets closer to the average of the whole population as it grows because the sample is more representative of the population as it becomes larger.
## events and sample spaces(S)
   A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, while an event is a subset of the sample space.
Eg:flip a fair coin the sample space is{H,T}
### dependent & indepemdent events
   dependent events are affected by the outcome of another event, while independent events are not
### joint probability
   joint probability is the likelihood of two events occurring together.
### marginal probability
   Marginal probability is the probability of an event irrespective of the outcome of another variable.
### conditional probability 
# Bayes theorem
   The conditional probability of an event A, given the occurrence of another event B, is equal to the product of the event of B, given A and the probability of A divided by the probability of event B.ie,P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B.
