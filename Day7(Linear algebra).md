# Linear algebra
## Matrix
  Matrix is rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns
  Notation: matrix 'A' with 'm' rows and'n' columns means (A)mxn
### Types of matrix
 - Row matrix
 - Column matrix
 - null matrix/zero matrix
 - square matrix
 - upper triangular
 - lower triangular
 - Diagonal matrix
 - Identity matrix
### Matrix operations
 * Addition
 * Subtraction
 * Scalar multiplication
 * Multiplication
 * Transpose
 * Inverse
## Vector
   vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Vectors can be represented mathematically or geometrically.
### Types of vector
  - Zero vector
  - Unit vector
    Vector with magnitude of 1.
    ####   unit vector=vector/magnitude of vector
  - parallel vector
     angle between 0deg or 180deg
  - Equal vector
  - Orthogonal vector
#### Dot product of a vector
  vector dot product is zero means,it is perpendicular(orthogonal) to each other.ie)angle between 90deg or 270deg
## Eigen values and Eigen vectors
   Eigenvector: A non-zero vector v that only changes by a scalar factor when a matrix A is applied to it:
  ####          Av=λ v
   Eigenvalue: The scalar λ associated with the eigenvector v.
## U-V Decomposition (Singular Value Decomposition, SVD)
   SVD: A factorization of a matrix A into three matrices:
   ####        A=U Σ V^T(U-Orthogonal matrix,Σ-Diagonal matrix,V^T-Transpose of a orthogonal matrix
## PCA(Principal Component Analysis
  The scalar value represent the amount of variance explained by each principal components
## Covariance of a matrix
   A square matrix that shows the covariance between each pair of elements in a random vector
