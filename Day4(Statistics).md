# Statistics
  The branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation.
### Purpose
   - To summarize and understand data characteristics.
   - To draw conclusions and make informed decisions.
## Descriptive statistics
  Set of methods used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, such as its central tendency, variability, and distribution. 
## Measures of central tendency 
  Describe the central value or typical representation of a dataset.
### Key measures
  - Mean
      #### Mean= Sum of all data points / Number of data points
  - median
      #### Odd case: median = middle value
      #### Even case: median = average of two middle values
  - mode
      #### : The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.(eg: 2,3,3,4,3 mode is 3)    
## DIspersion
   Describe the spread or variability of data around the central value.
### Key measures
   - Range
        #### Range = Maximum Value − Minimum Value
   - Variance
        #### Variance =∑( xi−Mean)^2/n
   - Standard Deviation (SD)
        #### SD= √ Variance
   - Interquartile Range (IQR)
        #### IQR = Q3 − Q1 [Q1 = First quartile (25th percentile), Q3 = Third quartile (75th percentile)]
## Correlation coefficient
  * positive correlation
  * Negative correlaton
  * Zero correlation
